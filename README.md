## This is a classic battleship game written in lua ##

### Demo ###
Run ``` lua battleship.lua  ```. 

### Customization and embedding ###
This version is not class-based while you can freely reintegrate it in your own projects by providing custom print function and a custom command injection cycle. See function ```battleshipDemo``` for further details.

### TODO ###
Rewrite this using classes for better incapsulation.
